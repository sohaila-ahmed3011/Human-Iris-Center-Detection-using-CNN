# human-iris-center-detection-using-CNN

This is an implementation to the CNN model architecture in the paper *Accurate Eye Pupil Localization Using Heterogeneous CNN Models*
- It was implemented on the publice dataset *GI4E*
- Multiple preprocessing stages were executed on the dataset to reach the required format of predictors and labels
- Then the CNN model was trained and tested on ten different images
